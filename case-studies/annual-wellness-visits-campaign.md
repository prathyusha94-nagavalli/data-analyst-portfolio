ðŸ“Š Campaign Performance Analytics: Annual Wellness Trends
Overview
This case study showcases a business intelligence initiative aimed at analyzing the effectiveness of year-over-year member outreach 
campaigns, with a focus on Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs). The objective was to empower stakeholders with campaign KPIs that measured 
member participation, outreach success, and the delivery of wellness summaries to providersâ€”all critical for improving HEDIS Star Ratings.

Problem
Despite launching multiple campaigns to encourage AWVs and close care gaps, the organization lacked a centralized way to evaluate 
performance over time. Departments couldn't easily assess how their outreach translated into member action or whether provider-facing 
reports were delivered timely. Leadership needed better visibility to prioritize high-impact interventions.

My Role
As part of the BI team, I:

Collaborated with business units to define KPIs for campaign performance:

% of eligible members completing AWVs (YoY)

% of members who received outreach but did not schedule visits

% of AWV summaries delivered to primary care providers (PCPs)

Queried and wrangled data from claims, eligibility, and outreach systems using SQL.

Built interactive dashboards to track these KPIs across plan years and member cohorts.

Created YoY trend visualizations that allowed teams to compare campaign impact by geography, member risk tier, and outreach channel.

Tools & Technologies
SQL Server / Snowflake â€“ Extracted and joined data from member eligibility, outreach logs, and claims tables.

Power BI / Tableau â€“ Designed dashboards for visualizing YoY performance and campaign KPIs.

Excel / SSRS â€“ Delivered static summaries for compliance and field teams.

Outcome
Enabled leadership to see a 3-year trend in AWV completion rates, highlighting a 12% increase from targeted outreach.

Helped outreach teams adjust timing and frequency of campaigns based on PCP engagement metrics.

Supported provider relations in identifying clinics with low AWV report receipt, improving follow-up processes.

Contributed to improved HEDIS scores by aligning campaign strategies with measurable KPIs.
