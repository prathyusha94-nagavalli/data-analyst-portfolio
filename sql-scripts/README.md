# SQL Scripts Portfolio

This folder contains real-world SQL scripts based on my professional experience as a Senior Data Analyst. Each script is designed to demonstrate practical SQL skills, such as:

- Data wrangling and transformation
- Joins across multiple datasets
- Window functions for advanced aggregation
- Cost and performance analysis using realistic business logic
